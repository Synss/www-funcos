With {funcos} we propose an interdisciplinary coordinated research program
which will aim at providing the urgently required fundamental understanding in
the emerging field of organic films on oxides.  Our strategy is based on a
unique combination of competences at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität
Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in the fields of organic molecular films and of oxide
surfaces and nanostructures.

The first phase of the project concentrates on simple molecular films on simple
oxides.  The fundamental knowledge gained will lead to the second phase of the
project where complex films on nanostructured oxide surfaces are studied.
Finally, we will also address oxide nanostructures and structure–property
relationships.

In order to obtain maximum coherence within this collaborative research
project, three prototype oxides: MgO, cobalt oxides (CoO, Co\ :sub:`3`\ O\
:sub:`4`\ ), and TiO\ :sub:`2` were selected and the target molecules are the
important class of tetrapyrrole derivatives.  The {funcos} Showcase Systems
propose specific examples from these toolboxes.


Phase 1: Controlled growth of uniform organic films on uniform oxide surfaces
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

{img;../img/rp-phase1.png;Phase 1: From uncontrolled to controlled growth; left}
The aim of Phase 1 is the growth of uniform molecular films of organic molecules
on simple oxide surfaces.  The primary goal of {funcos} is to develop a general
knowledge-driven approach.  To this end, the detailed understanding of the
bonding sites, the bonding mechanisms and energetics, and the kinetics of
structure formation is paramount.  From these fundamental insights, the common
principles that control the growth and the properties of organic molecules on
oxide surfaces will emerge.  To exemplify the new concepts underlying {funcos},
we plan to demonstrate how the growth mode of an organic molecular film on an
ordered oxide surface can be switched from a disordered three-dimensional growth
to a two-dimensional growth with well-defined molecular orientation, and short-
and long-range order.


Phase 2: Nanostructured organic films on nanostructured oxide surfaces
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim Phase 2 is the controlled formation of nanostructured films.  The
general principles that govern selectivity in molecule–oxide interaction must be
explored.  Here, {funcos} strategy involves patterned oxide surfaces and the use
of linker units on the organic molecules.  Dimensionality and size of the
structural areas will be varied from the nano to the micrometer range.  Our goal
is the preparation of a two-dimensional nanostructured film with atomically
well-defined anchoring sites, molecular orientation, and order.


Phase 3:  Nanostructures, structure-property relationships, and routes for utilization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, a subset of molecule–oxide systems will be chosen based on the results
of Phase 1 and Phase 2, and based on potential relevance for application, e.g.
in the fields of molecular electronics, solar energy conversion, sensors, or
catalysis.  These systems may preferentially come from the {funcos} toolboxes,
but this part is explicitly open to other molecule–oxide systems as well.  The
idea is that the conceptual understanding generated by {funcos} has a general
impact for functional organic layers on oxide surfaces.  Oxide nanostructures, a
field where some {funcos} partners provide exceptional expertise, will start to
play an essential role in this project phase.  Moreover, we will focus on the
transfer of {funcos} research from ideal UHV to realistic growth and operating
conditions: How can the new concepts and building principles be transferred from
ideal to realistic conditions?

It is our vision that, at this point, knowledge-based functional landscaping of
real oxide surfaces will become a realistic strategy for the design of novel
hybrid materials.
