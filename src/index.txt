The properties of ultra-thin layers of large organic molecules like porphyrins,
phthalocyanines, and other tetrapyrroles on oxide and dielectric substrates
offer potential applications in the fields of molecular electronics, solar
energy conversion, catalysis, sensor development, and biointerfacial
engineering. There is one common feature to all application-related research in
these areas: The functional organic units constituting the organic films are
synthesized with atomic precision but the oxide bonding sites, the interaction
mechanisms, and the structure formation processes on the dielectric substrate
remain poorly understood at the microscopic level. Some information on the
interaction of functional groups with oxide surfaces is available for small
molecules but the transfer to larger systems is entirely unexplored from a
surface science perspective. Despite the practical relevance of the emerging
field of organic/oxide interfaces, it is apparent that, from a surface science
point of view, the research area is in its very infancy.

	<h4>“Our current knowledge ends at the interface”</h4>

The reason for this lack of understanding is the fact that a surface science
approach to organic/oxide interfaces is outstandingly challenging, both for
experiment and theory. Systematic investigations of the underlying physical and
chemical interaction mechanisms require a broad spectrum of complementary
expertise. Hence, {funcos} developed a systematic strategy addressing the
fundamental understanding of functional organic/oxide interfaces.

We chose prototype oxide surfaces as substrates that can be characterized at
the atomic level. A broad spectrum of state-of-the-art experimental and
theoretical surface science techniques is employed to unravel the interactions
and growth mechanism of test molecules of reduced complexity with ideal oxide
surfaces and defects. This atomic-level perspective allows us to build complex
systems in a controlled fashion. Such systems include nanostructured
multicomponent films on nanostructured oxide surfaces, supported nanoparticles,
and oxide nanomaterials.
