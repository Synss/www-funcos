Molecular Interactions Area
---------------------------

Three specific projects constitute the *Molecular Interactions Area*.  These
projects are targeting the experimental investigation of local
molecule–molecule and molecule–oxide interactions, primarily in ideal
{acro;UHV} environment.  They address the key issues in experimental surface
science: the microscopic surface structure ({funcos} 1), the electronic surface
structure ({funcos} 2), and the local surface chemistry ({funcos} 3).

- `{funcos} 2: Spectroscopy and Electronic Structure <funcos2.shtml>`_
- `{funcos} 3: Molecule–Oxide Bond Formation <funcos3.shtml>`_


Structure Formation Area
------------------------

Based on the thorough understanding of microscopic interaction, the second
operational area of {funcos} will address structure formation.  Two main targets
are identified:

- An in-depth understanding of structure formation of functional organic films
  on oxide surfaces and nanostructures based on tailored molecule–substrate and
  molecule–molecule interactions.
- The controlled fabrication of molecular films on oxide nanostructures,
  leading to composites with tailored structural, electronic, and chemical
  properties.

Corresponding activities will include the structural investigation of organic
adlayers on long-range ordered surfaces and their evolution upon adsorption
({funcos} 4) and on more complex metal oxide substrates, such as oxide
nanostructures ({funcos} 5).  A detailed exploration of the mechanisms of
structure formation will lead to substantially new insights into the
fundamental principles of supramolecular ordering at dimensions ranging from
nanometer-sized aggregates to objects at the mesoscale.  Moreover, the
*Structure Formation Area* will contribute to a better understanding of
structure formation and to establishment of structure–property relationships up
to significantly enhanced complexity.  Based on the local picture from the
`Molecular Interactions Area`_ these activities will facilitate the controlled
fabrication of complex molecular architectures on oxide supports.

Theory Area
-----------

Close interlinking between the experimental projects and the *Theory Area* is
vital within {funcos}.  Therefore, each project in the `Molecular Interactions
Area`_ and the `Structure Formation Area`_ is related to its counterpart
activities in the *Theory Area*.  This coordinated interplay will be the key to
understand functional molecular structures on oxides at the level of detail
that we are aiming at.

The *Theory Area* consists of three domains.  **Domain I: Molecular Bonding and
Spectroscopic Signatures** investigates the basic adsorption properties of
molecules on oxide surfaces (`{funcos} Oxide Toolbox <../toolboxes.shtml>`_).
Besides ground state geometric and electronic structures, spectroscopic
({acro;IRAS}, {acro;XPS}, {acro;STS}) and imaging ({acro;STM}) data shall be
considered.  **Domain II: Excited States and Photoexcitation** investigates
electronic excitations of adsorbate structures and their coupling to the metal
oxide.  In addition to excitation spectra, the lifetime of excited states will
elucidate the dynamics of electron transfer processes.  **Domain III:
Intermolecular Interactions and Structure Formation** is concerned with
adsorbate arrangements, from simple to nanostructured films.  The interplay of
adsorbate–substrate and adsorbate–adsorbate interactions during structure
formation shall be investigated, also including the role of surface defects,
structuring, and the interaction with small molecules.  By proceeding from
basic interaction mechanisms to complex film structures and properties, the
*Theory Area* shall provide a microscopic-level understanding at each
individual step and, thus, will help to establish the design rules that
{funcos} is aiming for.
