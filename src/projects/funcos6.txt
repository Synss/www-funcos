Domain I: Molecular Bonding and Spectroscopic Signatures
--------------------------------------------------------

{img;../img/funcos6.png;right}  First-principles methods, specifically based on
{acro;DFT}, shall be used to determine adsorption geometries and energies for
molecules on pristine, defective, and pre-structured oxide surfaces (`{funcos}
Molecular and Oxide Toolboxes <../toolboxes.shtml>`_).  Calculations of energy
landscapes will provide first insight into geometric structures of adsorbate
systems and related interaction mechanisms.  Systematic studies of binding
properties will support the experiments in `{funcos} 1`_ and `{funcos} 3`_ to
identify linker groups with selective bonding to specific sites.  Vibrational
frequencies will be calculated and used to interpret {acro;IRAS} data obtained
in {funcos} 3.  Also, {acro;XPS} chemical shifts will be predicted and compared
to those measured in `{funcos} 2`_ and 3.  Moreover, {acro;STM} and {acro;AFM}
images from {funcos} 1 will be simulated based on structures, orbitals, and
eigenvalues obtained in {acro;DFT} calculations. The interplay of Domain I with
{funcos} 1 and {funcos} 3 shall result in a comprehensive characterization and
understanding of basic adsorbate–substrate interactions of organic molecules on
oxides.


Domain II: Excited States and Photoexcitations
----------------------------------------------

The electronic structure and photophysics of molecules (`{funcos} Molecular
Toolbox`_) adsorbed on oxides (`{funcos} Oxide Toolbox`_) will be investigated
by first-principles methods within the framework of {acro;DFT}, time-dependent
{acro;DFT}, and many body perturbation theory within GW and BSE approaches.
Electron transfer processes between the adsorbate and the metal oxide shall be
analyzed based on calculated quasiparticle spectra and excited states including
their lifetime.  The resulting insights into electronic structure will provide a
microscopic understanding of the effect of linker groups on excited state
properties and on electron transfer processes (investigated in `{funcos} 2`_).
Electron transfer with metal oxides may also include low-coordinated surface
sites (e.g. oxygen vacancies and steps) as sinks or sources of electrons.
Adsorbates interacting with such sites may show distinct electron transfer and
optical properties; aspects that shall be included in photophysical
investigations.  The latter will be closely linked with {funcos} 2 and will
contribute to optical characterization in `{funcos} 5`_.  It will build on
insights from `{funcos} 1`_ and the other domains of {funcos} 6. 


Domain III: Intermolecular Interactions and Structure Formation
---------------------------------------------------------------

Domain III will focus on understanding growth processes and structure formation.
{acro;DFT} calculations on aggregates of small test molecules (`{funcos}
Molecular Toolbox`_) with linker groups shall yield first information on basic
adsorbate–adsorbate interactions (direct or substrate mediated), in parallel
with experimental studies in `{funcos} 1`_, `{funcos} 2`_ and `{funcos} 3`_.
These calculations will be extended to assemblies of larger organic molecules
(e.g. porphyrins, `{funcos} Showcases`_) using semiempirical, parameterized
tight-binding methods, supplemented by empirical force field terms to take into
account van-der-Waals interactions.  The coverage dependence of binding energies
and geometries will yield information on intermolecular interactions in relation
to the direct molecule–substrate bonding.  We aim at providing guidelines for
`{funcos} 4`_ and `{funcos} 5`_ on how to control structure formation and
self-organization in adsorbate layers by linker or spacer groups.  From an
analysis of the thermodynamic stability of layer structures it can be deduced
how film formation may be influenced by the preparation conditions.  This also
includes, for instance, surface reduction or hydroxylation as a result of the
environmental conditions during growth.  Finally, transition states will be
calculated in order to obtain insight into the kinetics of early stages of
structure formation, growth, and self-organization, experimentally investigated
in {funcos} 4 and 5.

Objectives
----------

The proposed theory project aims at a comprehensive theoretical understanding
at the microscopic, i.e., quantum mechanical, level of the adsorbate-substrate
and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions of functionalized organic molecules on
structured oxide surfaces, which eventually shall enable controlled formation
of organic films with specific structural, electronic and optical properties
and rationally designed functionalities in areas such as catalysis, sensoring,
or photo-chemistry.  To that end methods based on {acro;DFT} supplemented by
means to treat Van-der-Waals interactions and, where necessary, strong
correlation shall be applied.  For large systems {acro;DFT}-derived
semi-empirical tight-binding methods shall be employed.  Specifically, we aim
at understanding

- **adsorbate–substrate interactions of organic test molecules**, e.g, benzene
  derivatives with different linker groups, with pristine oxide surfaces and
  with low-coordinated sites on structured oxide substrates;
- **adsorbate–substrate interactions of larger functionalized (metal)organic
  molecules**, e.g., metalloporphyrines, with pristine and defective oxide
  surfaces;
- **charge transfer processes and modifications of electronic and optical
  properties of functionalized organic molecules** upon adsorption on structured
  oxide surfaces;
- **adsorbate-adsorbate interactions of functionalized organic molecules** on
  structured oxide surfaces;
- **spectroscopic and imaging data (IRAS, XPS, STM, STS, AFM, EPR, or 2PPE)** by
  analyzing and simulating experimental data on the basis of electronic
  structure calculations;
- how the **formation of functional surface structures** depends on the
  interplay of adsorbate-substrate and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions of
  functionalized organic molecules on structured oxide surfaces;
- the **reaction and activation of small molecules** with metalorganic molecules
  like metalloporphyrins arranged on a structured oxide surface.
