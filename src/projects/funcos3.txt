{img;../img/funcos3.png;right}  {funcos} 3 will target at the elucidation of
reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and energetics when functional molecules are
(reactively) linked to oxide surfaces.  The chemistry of molecule–surface
interactions will be studied by (time-resolved) {acro;IRAS} and {acro;XPS} in
{acro;UHV}.  Information on molecular orientation, conformation, reaction
mechanisms, and chemical transformations of molecules and linker groups will be
made available.  Ideal oxides, nanostructured model surfaces (oxide/oxide and
metal/oxide), and oxide nanostructures will be investigated to address
selectivity issues and bridge the gap between simple and complex oxide
interfaces elaborated in {funcos} 5.  Temperature-dependent {acro;XPS} and
{acro;IRAS}, {acro;MB} methods and {acro;TPD} will provide information on the
energetics and microkinetics.  These methods will also be used in explorative
reactivity studies of oxide surfaces with organic layers.  Using
{acro;PM}-{acro;IRAS}, {acro;DRIFTS}, and high-pressure {acro;XPS}, the pressure
range from {acro;UHV} to ambient conditions will be covered on both single
crystals and nanostructures. 


Objectives
----------

In {funcos} 3, vibrational spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy will be
used to elucidate the elementary mechanisms, energetics, and kinetics of bond
formation between functionalized organic molecules and oxide surfaces under
{acro;UHV} conditions. Transferability to ambient conditions and to engineered
nanomaterials will be simultaneously explored. We will address the following
issues:

- Resolve the **reaction mechanism upon transformation of selected functional
  groups** attached to `{funcos} Test Molecules <../toolboxes.shtml>`_ during
  bond formation at oxide surfaces.
- Quantify the **energy of formation and the thermal stability** of the
  surface-bound species.
- Study the **usability of these anchors to link large functional molecules** to
  oxide surfaces and control their molecular orientation and arrangement.
- Investigate the concept of **multiple coordinations through chelating and
  bifunctional linkers** and investigate the influence on molecular orientation,
  formation barriers, and thermal stability of the surface-bound species.
- Control the **site selectivity of surface-linking reactions**, i.e. the
  potential to address specific surface sites by specific anchor groups on
  nanostructured oxide surfaces exposing different sites.
- Find the **role of reactive environments** by studying the influence of
  reactants on the linking reactions and, vice versa, the influence of the
  organic layer on the surface reactivity.


Systems and strategy
--------------------

We will address the above questions in {acro;UHV}, primarily combining
vibrational spectroscopy ({acro;IRAS}, including {acro;TR} {acro;IRAS}) and
{acro;XPS} (including angle-resolved {acro;XPS} and high-resolution {acro;XPS}
using synchrotron radiation).  Recently, the applicants have demonstrated the
ideal complementarity of these techniques in relation to previous cooperation
projects [1]_.  In brief, {acro;IRAS} provides unprecedented “chemical
resolution” to differentiate between surface species, bonding geometries, and
sites.  {acro;XPS} yields detailed information on the oxidation state and the
chemical environment of the atoms of adsorbed species, also in cases where no
information can be obtained from {acro;IRAS}.  In addition, we will apply
{acro;TPD} and {acro;MB} methods, to address temperature-dependent reactivity.
To link the {acro;UHV} model studies to “real world” applications, we will
explore elevated and ambient pressures by {acro;PM}-{acro;IRAS} and, if
required, {acro;HP}-{acro;XPS} as an additional high-pressure method.  Also, we
will perform studies on engineered nanomaterials using in-situ {acro;DRIFTS}.

By following a closely synchronized work program, synergies between the applied
methods will be maximized.  We will start by studying ordered MgO(100) films on
Ag(100) in the {acro;UHV} part, and in parallel compare to MgO nanocube powders
provided by `{funcos} 5`_.  In the second project phase we will
proceed to other oxide materials, i.e. Co\ :sub:`3`\ O\ :sub:`4`\ , and finally
to TiO\ :sub:`2` surfaces.  In parallel, we will start to explore nanostructured
oxide surfaces, e.g. defect structures, oxide nanoparticles, and metal
nanoparticles supported on these oxides.

.. Oxide Toolbox was mentioned above

As representative selection of anchor groups (R) we will first explore -CN (soft
Lewis base, polar), -OH (weak Brønsted acid), -COOH (strong Brønsted acid), and
-NH\ :sub:`2` (Brønsted/Lewis base), and later proceed to other linkers
depending on the obtained results. As test molecules we will start using benzene
derivates, e.g.  C\ :sub:`6`\ H\ :sub:`5`\ R, where isotopically labeled C\
:sub:`6`\ D\ :sub:`5`\ R will be chosen to optimize detection in {acro;IR} when
required.  These test molecules will easily allow us to proceed to bifunctional
and chelating linkers by investigation of doubly-substituted benzene derivates
(C\ :sub:`6`\ H\ :sub:`4`\ R\ :sub:`2`, C\ :sub:`6`\ H\ :sub:`4`\ RR’).  From
the results obtained, the most promising linkers will be selected and introduced
as linking elements into functional units.  To this end, we will start by
exploring 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin (2HTPP) and its linker-substituted
derivates.  The influence of molecule–oxide bond formation on the molecular
orientation, film growth, film stability, and surface reactivity will be
explored.
