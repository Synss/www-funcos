{img;../img/funcos4.png;right}  {funcos} 4 focuses on structural aspects of
organic adlayers and nanostructures including their correlations with the oxide
substrate.  We will take advantage of the strong expertise at the {acro;FAU} in
x ray and neutron diffraction in surface sensitive modes to characterize
adlayer structures and adsorption dynamics. Reflectometry and {acro;GID} focus
on geometrical aspects including the full three-dimensional arrangement of the
entire complex consisting of the substrate, the linker, and the functional
molecule with accuracies in the sub-Ångstrom regime.  The diffraction methods
will be complemented by direct imaging, spectroscopic, microscopic
({acro;LEEM}), and microspectroscopic methods x ray ({acro;PEEM},
micro-{acro;NEXAFS}).  The latter will reveal geometric and electronic features
from the atomic and molecular to the nano- and mesoscale.  Spatially resolved
{acro;NEXAFS} probes unoccupied orbitals and monitors molecule-substrate
interactions with superior sensitivity.  Resonant {acro;XPS} and Resonant
{acro;AES} applied to electronic relaxation processes in weakly bound molecules
will elucidate their intermolecular and molecule–substrate interactions.


Objectives
----------

{funcos} 4 aims at a deeper understanding of the basic processes in the
formation of differently prepared organic thin films on various oxide surfaces
(single crystal substrates,  nanostructured oxides, amorphous substrates). 

- This includes aspects of interactions, in particular the **interplay of
  intermolecular interactions and molecule–substrate interactions**, which are
  governing the growth of ultrathin organic films (perpendicular and lateral
  structures, molecular orientation and tilt).
- Utilizing probes, which offer information ranging from the atomic to the
  mesoscopic length scale, the **structural properties of adsorbed organic
  films** from the submonolayer to the multilayer regime can be accessed.
- Diffraction techniques ({acro;XRD}/{acro;LEED}) deliver structural
  information with accuracies better than 0.01 nm, and in-situ studies can make
  the **film growth kinetics** visible.
- Various microscopy techniques ({acro;PEEM}, {acro;STXM}, {acro;LEEM}) shall
  be employed to provide the growth mode (layers, islands, or random growth)
  and **film formation kinetics** in real space with resolutions on the
  mesoscopic length scale, i.e., from lateral dimensions ranging from 20 to
  10.000 nm.

The project will bridge the gap from model systems prepared under ultrahigh
vacuum conditions to molecular depositions from solvents thus offering
potential pathways to prepare highly ordered molecular systems without costly
hardware. 


Systems and strategy
--------------------

The systems under investigation will focus on the {funcos} toolbox with
particular emphasis on metalloporphyrin systems (preferably Mg, Co and Pt metal
centers) with functional ligands. For the study of self-assembled monolayers
using tetraphenyl porphyrin frameworks ({acro;POR-SAM}s) in particular -OH and
-COOH linker groups are considered promising candidates to form a covalent bond
with the surface hydroxyl groups via separation of water resulting in a
self-assembled monolayer [1]_.  As substrates we will use amorphous and single
crystalline TiO\ :sub:`2` and MgO (amorphous substrates will be prepared in an
in-project cooperation with R. Fink via sputtering techniques, single crystals
will be acquired commercially.  Further, silicon-supported MgO nanocubes in the
uncompressed phase and as textured coatings will be utilized as substrates.
These will be prepared in `{funcos} 5`_.  The unique nanoscale structure which
can be tuned by the nanocube size and the compression is expected to influence
the {acro;POR-SAM} arrangement.  The boundaries between the nanocubes will
provide a highly reactive surface compared to the nanocube planes, and the
{acro;POR-SAM}s are expected to dock on in a highly correlated manner with
these substrates.  The orientational distribution will be assessed by us via
powder-, single crystal- and thin film x-ray techniques in close cooperation
with `{funcos} 5`_.

To monitor the film growth under {acro;UHV} conditions, ultrathin MgO films
grown on Ag(100) substrates shall be used.  Again metalloporphyrins with planar
and axial ligands will be employed.  To improve the spectroscopic contrast in
electron spectroscopy (contrast in binding energy with respect to the MgO
substrate) we favor metalloporphyrins with Co and Pt centers.  Deposition will
be made using homemade Knudsen cells while the deposition is monitored by mass
spectrometry and quartz microbalance or in-situ film growth (in {acro;PEEM}).    

The structure of the {acro;SAM}s will be investigated first on our laboratory
reflectometer, a new custom-modified D8-diffractometer with highly flexible
x-ray optics including the options for Cu- and Mo-radiation.  The reflectivity
mode shows the structure along the surface normal of the monolayer [2]_, and the
{acro;GID} mode mirrors the lateral structure which represents the in-plane
correlations [3]_.  These data will yield comprehensive information on the
thickness, the electron density and the roughness along the surface normal as
well as the lateral structure of the monolayer.  The resulting electron density
profile will be chemically and geometrically interpreted to provide a model for
the structure of the {acro;SAM}.  Particular interest lies in structural
differences of the monolayer on the different oxide substrates.  Referring to
other systems like alkanoles on sapphire epitaxial behavior is expected for the
single crystalline substrates as the lateral structure of the monolayer is
expected to correlate with well-defined bonding sites [4]_.  This is also
expected to be the case for the MgO nanocube substrates as the boundary regions
between the nanocubes are highly reactive compared to the nanocube planes.

Interruption of the {acro;SAM} growth by taking substrates out off solution
will yield information on the growth kinetics [5]_.  The evolution of the layer
thickness in these ex-situ measurements of interrupted growth will further show
the growth mode.  This information will be validated via complementary real
space investigations such as {acro;AFM} (`{funcos} 1`_) and chemical
spectroscopy (`{funcos} 3`_) providing insight in the chemical bonding
mechanism.  In addition, our model from scattering data will be compared with
theoretical considerations (`{funcos} 6`_).

A further strategic aim of this project is to perform in-situ measurements of
the formation of the surface coating in the reaction bath.  We have ample
experience in building suitable sample environments.  The measurements will be
done in part on our laboratory instrument already mentioned with Mo radiation
where we can penetrate up 1 cm through the reaction liquid while still having a
dynamic range of more than 7 orders of magnitude!  In addition to providing
already valuable information, such data are highly desirable to prepare for and
optimize measurements at synchrotron sources where high intensity instruments
operating at shorter wavelengths are available.  The synchrotron data to be
taken in reflectivity, {acro;GID} and {acro;GISAS} are expected to make the
growth of {acro;POR-SAM}s under wet conditions visible in great detail [6]_.

In-situ neutron reflectivity and grazing incident diffraction measurements of
the growth of {acro;POR-SAM}s will complement whenever indicated the in-situ
synchrotron data.  Neutrons have the virtue of a high sensitivity for organic
molecules in particular when H/D isotopic marking is being applied [7]_.
