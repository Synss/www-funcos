{img;../img/funcos5.png;right}  Oxide nanostructures often show modified cell
parameters, composition, or morphology, providing access to new materials with
novel properties.  Among the important aspects are size-dependent geometric and
electronic properties, resulting in modified transport properties.  Also, inert
oxides can become highly reactive when applied in highly dispersed form.  Guided
by insights into local interaction mechanisms (`{funcos} 1`_, `{funcos} 2`_,
and `{funcos} 3`_ and `{funcos} 6`_) and structure formation on planar surfaces
(`{funcos} 4`_ and 6), {funcos} 5 aims at transferring the obtained knowledge to
different types of oxide nanostructures.

The participating workgroups have exceptional expertise with a broad range of
preparation techniques for nanostructured oxide materials, including anodic
oxidation of metal surfaces, {acro;FEBIP}, or {acro;CVS}.  Self-organized TiO\
:sub:`2` nanotube layers on metal substrates can be obtained by electrochemical
etching and represent a unique model system for monolayer attachment of organic
molecules.  The use of electron beams represents an excellent and particularly
clean tool to locally modify the properties of oxide materials.  Localized
electron probes such as {acro;SEM} have made it possible to apply
electron-induced processes at the nanometer scale and will be used to generate
nanostructures with lithographic control.  Finally, {acro;CVS} at reduced
pressure is particularly well suited for the production of metal oxide
nanocrystals with small size and narrow size distribution.  The comparison
between vacuum sublimation and solution deposition of organic molecules will
reveal the key mechanisms of binding and structure formation.  Comparison of
differently prepared systems with different surface structure will provide
information on specific molecule–substrate interactions.  Moreover,
investigations of particle–particle interaction effects and the effect of the
reaction environment will allow for a more general understanding of
organic/oxide surface chemistry under realistic conditions. 


Objectives
----------

{funcos} 5 aims at the transfer of atomic level insights obtained by surface
science techniques on plane and atomically clean surfaces ({funcos} 1–3) to 3D
high surface area materials, which—in terms of structure and chemical
composition—are significantly more complex. Oxide nano-structures—with and
without supporting substrates—will be established as complementary model
systems for {funcos} adsorption studies. The major goals of {funcos} 5 are

- the **fabrication of oxide nanostructures** with increasing complexity by
  different synthesis and preparation routes for metal oxide substrates of
  defined shape and controlled spatial arrangement;
- the investigation of the **adsorption behavior of functional molecules on
  oxide nanostructures**;
- the **design of complex molecule–oxide interface structures** including the
  generation of radiation induced defects as means to control adsorption.


Systems and strategy
--------------------

Morphologically different MgO, TiO\ :sub:`2` and CoO\ :sub:`x` nanostructures
will be employed.  For their fabrication different routes such as anodic
oxidation of metal surfaces, {acro;FEBIP} or {acro;CVS} in conjunction with
deposition approaches to generate textured nanocrystal layers will be applied.
Different morphologies and microstructures will be employed.  These will range
from nanocrystal ensembles at various stages of aggregation and texturing,
through nanotubular metal oxide arrangements of adjustable pore orientation and
connectivities to compact metal oxide films deposited under {acro;UHV}
conditions.  It is the starting point of {funcos} 5 to make use of synthesis and
preparation routes that are already established in the other groups to further
develop them for the generation of thin films and particle based nanostructures
of controlled spatial arrangement.

The adsorption behavior of these structures toward functional molecules as well
as the impact of defects thereon will be of central interest.  We will search
for preferred adsorption sites on the above-mentioned nanostructures and will
compare differences in the adsorption of liquids in vacuum as well as in liquid
phases.  Adsorption-induced changes in the electronic, magnetic and catalytic
properties will be addressed with spectroscopy.  This part of the project will
also include the characterization of photo-electrochemical reactivity and
photoluminescence properties of the as synthesized as well as of
adsorbate-covered TiO\ :sub:`2`, MgO and CoO\ :sub:`x` nanostructures. As an
extension to nanostructure fabrication we will study the effect of radiation of
different energy and nature on nanostructures as means to increase control over
nanostructure growth and functionalization.  For this purpose, we will employ
sample exposure to photons, electrons and ions (three-beams concept) in order to
generate selected surface elements as adsorption sites for molecules in the
`{funcos} Molecular Toolbox`_.  The radiation induced generation of defects,
e.g.  point defects that arise from local oxygen deficiencies or vacancy
interstitial pairs, will be of interest for the introduction of new adsorption
sites on the surface of oxide nanostructures.  Ultimately, we aim at the
rational design of oxide nanostructures, i.e. the establishment of optimized
synthesis and engineering protocols to generate nanostructured templates for the
site selective adsorption of functional molecules from the `{funcos} molecular
toolbox`_.
