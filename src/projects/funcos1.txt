{img;../img/funcos1.png;right}  In {funcos} 1, scanning probe methods
({acro;STM} and {acro;AFM}) will be applied in {acro;UHV}.  A broad temperature
range will be accessible from 5 to 300 K, ensuring that even weak
molecule–oxide interactions can be studied.  Characterization of adsorption
geometries and sites (e.g.  defects) will be feasible with atomic precision,
also providing information on mobility and diffusion barriers.
{acro;LT}-{acro;STS} will allow for investigating the molecular electronic
structure.  {acro;AFM} will address molecules on non-conductive oxides that
will be of relevance for direct correlation with nanostructured bulk oxides in
`{funcos} 5`_.


Objectives
----------

- Establish the **adsorption sites and geometries** of bare linker units and
  porphyrins with added linker units on magnesium and cobalt oxides (thin film
  or bulk), the influence of defects, oxide film thickness, and surface
  termination.
- Investigate the **electronic structure of individual porphyrins** on MgO and
  cobalt oxide surfaces: frontier orbitals, local work function and charge
  distribution.
- Analyze the lateral homogeneity and **quality of self-assembled molecular
  layers**.
- Quantify the **energy barriers for diffusing molecules** on MgO and cobalt
  oxide surfaces.

The atomic scale insight provided in this project will clarify important
mechanisms on the molecular level to achieve the {funcos} vision of functional
landscaping of oxide surfaces.


Systems and strategy
--------------------

{funcos} 1 employs {acro;STM} and {acro;AFM} in {acro;UHV}.  Oxide surfaces
(MgO, CoO) will be prepared either by cleaving single crystals and suitable
post-processing in {acro;UHV} or by growing well-defined oxide layers on clean
metal surfaces in {acro;UHV} (e.g., MgO on Ag(100) and CoO on Ir(100)).
Defects on the oxide surfaces will be deliberately introduced by ion
bombardment.  After characterization of the oxide surfaces and their
characteristic defects by {acro;AFM}, {acro;STM}, and also {acro;LEED},
molecules will be deposited from the gas phase in {acro;UHV}.  If necessary,
methods and parameters for bringing the various molecules into the gas phase
under {acro;UHV} conditions will be developed in cooperation with our {funcos}
partners.  Simple methods like thermal evaporation of molecular powders or
dosing molecules from a liquid supply have been tested and used in the two
workgroups of {funcos} 1.  With these methods the coverage of molecules can be
chosen from sub-monolayer to the monolayer regime for studying the properties
of individual adsorbed molecules but also of self-assembly and inter-molecular
interaction.  Molecular adsorption can take place at temperatures ranging from
40 to 1000 K.  Additionally various metals can be co-adsorbed.

The molecules used in {funcos} 1 come from the `{funcos} Molecular Toolbox
<../toolboxes.shtml>`_.  At the beginning of the project various {funcos} Test
Molecules will be deposited on the oxide surfaces and their adsorption
properties studied.  Since the molecules can only interact either via the
functional group or the benzene π-system the relevant interaction can be
properly determined.  In view of the {funcos} vision of functionalizing oxide
surfaces by organic molecules the investigation of the interaction of
porphyrins will consume the major share of the project duration.  The large
molecules will allow a detailed mapping of electronic properties.

As a start, we will consider singly functionalized molecules but for steering
the self-assembly of these, multiply functionalized molecules will also be
considered and chosen carefully after consultation with our {funcos} partners.
Self-assembly processes will also be modified by adding metal atoms to the
molecular overlayer in {acro;UHV}.  This can either be accomplished in
simultaneous co-adsorption of molecules and metal atoms or by seeding oxide
surfaces with metal atoms prior to molecular adsorption or by evaporation of
metals onto an existing oxide–molecule system.  The setups will also allow
co-adsorption of more than one molecular species, however, such experiments are
not foreseen during the currently requested funding period.

The molecular systems prepared will be transferred in situ to the scanning
probe instruments primarily working at liquid helium temperatures for stability
and sensitivity reasons.  However, working at other fix-point temperatures
(liquid nitrogen and room temperature) and within temperature ranges of ~10 K
around these fix-points is also possible.  {funcos} 1 workpackages WP 1 and WP
2 require atomic- or molecular-scale lateral resolution of the molecule–oxide
system, WP 3 makes use of spectroscopic methods.  The planned experiments
require a extreme stability of the instruments but also of the adsorbate on the
substrate surface that can only be guaranteed by a low-temperature environment. 

Not only the starting point of the project (`{funcos} Showcase systems
<../toolboxes.shtml>`_) but also the subsequent experiments will be conducted
in close collaboration with other {funcos} groups to maximize the synergetic
effect inherent in the complementarity of {funcos} methods.  {funcos} 1 will
provide local site information to the other {funcos} projects and will help to
unravel molecular configurations encountered in adsorption or self-assembly.
Further, ensemble averaging structural and spectroscopic experiments carried
out by the {funcos} partners and the support from theory in `{funcos} 6`_ will
provide a solid ground on which the scanning probe experiments can be
interpreted.
