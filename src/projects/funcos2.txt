{img;../img/funcos2.png;right}  {funcos} 2 will focus on the electronic
structure of functional organic molecules from the `{funcos} Molecular Toolbox
<../toolboxes.shtml>`_ on well-defined oxide surfaces.  Key targets will be the
electronic aspects of molecule–oxide interaction and of metal centers of
adsorbed tetrapyrroles including their reactivity.  In particular, we will
study how adsorption properties, electronic structure, and coordination
behavior are affected by the functionalization of the macrocycle and by the
interaction with specific surface sites, such as defects, steps, oxygen
vacancies, or hydroxyl groups.  The characterization of the chemical
interaction of small molecules with metal centers will provide a fundamental
picture of electronic origins of structure–property relationships. 

In this context, a second very important issue will be the dynamics of charge
transfer, i.e. the lifetime of excited molecular states of the organic
molecule.  Here, special focus will be on the modification of electronic
structure and excited state lifetimes caused by different oxide thicknesses and
different anchoring groups.  The valence band structure, unoccupied states, and
the lifetimes of excited electrons will be studied by {acro;UPS} and
{acro;2PPE} , the interaction of the metal centers with the oxide surface and
with the coordinating small molecules will be determined from {acro;XPS}.  In
addition, reactivity aspects, specifically related to the coordinated metal
centers, will be addressed by temperature programmed reaction and desorption
studies. 


Objectives
----------

In {funcos} 2, {acro;XPS}, {acro;UPS} and {acro;2PPE} will be used to
characterize the electronic structure and chemical properties of
tetraphenylporphyrins adsorbed on MgO(100) thin films. We will focus on the
preparation and characterization of well-ordered porphyrin layers, the
reactivity of the metal center and the changes induced by the adsorption of
small molecules on the metal center. We will link ultrahigh vacuum studies on
well-defined surfaces to high surface area materials. We aim to: 

- Study the **electronic properties of thin MgO(100) films** on Ag(100) as a
  function of thickness.
- **Create, identify, and quantify defects** on the MgO(100) films. 
- Investigate the **interaction of tetraphenylporphyrin**, platinum and cobalt
  tetraphenylporphyrin, and a functionalized platinum tetraphenylporphyrin
  **with the MgO(100) surface**. Focus will be on changes in the N 1s, Pt 4f, Co
  2p and valence band regions as the coverage is increased from submonolayers to
  multilayers.
- **Investigate simple reactions** with porphyrins on MgO(100) and extract
  **kinetic parameters**. Focus will be on metalation and adsorption of CO, NO,
  O\ :sub:`2`\ , O\ :sub:`3`\ , and H\ :sub:`2`\ S on the metal center and the
  influence this has on the valence band.
- **Characterize selected high surface area systems** from {funcos} 5 and
  investigate to which extent they can be described by the results obtained from
  the model systems.


Systems and strategy
--------------------

Whereas `{funcos} 1`_ and `{funcos} 3`_ initially focus on the adsorption of
small linker molecules from the `{funcos} Molecular Toolbox <../toolboxes.shtml>`_,
we will focus on the metallotetrapyrole unit itself, especially the properties
of the metal center and the four nitrogen atoms coordinating the metal center.
We will first look at the adsorption of simple tetraphenylporphyrins on
MgO(100), before we increase the complexity by studying a functionalized
tetraphenylporphyrin.  The specific functionalization could be a carboxylic
acid group, but will be chosen based on the results with small linker molecules
from {funcos} 1 and 3.

The studies will be carried out under {acro;UHV} on well-defined MgO(100) thin
films grown on single-crystalline Ag(100).  Well-defined surfaces, with
well-defined sites that can be modified in a well-defined manner are ideal
substrates to develop a fundamental understanding of how metallotetrapyroles
interact with different sites on oxide surfaces, such as terraces, steps, oxygen
vacancies and surface hydroxyl groups.  This understanding will later prove
critical in WP 3, where we approach the much more complicated nanostructured
materials prepared in `{funcos} 5`_.  Since most of the {funcos}
groups will initially use MgO(100) thin films as substrate, the growth studies
will very much be a collaborative effort between the groups.

For catalysis and sensor applications the adsorption of small molecules on the
metal centers of porphyrins plays an important role, and we will study how the
adsorption of CO, NO and H\ :sub:`2`\ S affect the electronic structure of the
porphyrins.  The binding of O\ :sub:`2` and CO to iron porphyrin in hemoglobin
is well known, and it has been observed that H\ :sub:`2`\ S can induce a
hibernation-like state in mice, possibly through the binding of H\ :sub:`2`\ S
to heme in complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) [1]_, [2]_, [3]_.  We will
furthermore extract the adsorption energies of the small molecules to the metal
center, using {acro;TPD}, and even attempt to run simple reactions such as CO
oxidation.

The detailed characterization of homogeneous molecular layers on different
oxidic substrates sets the stage for investigating, in great detail,
electronically excited molecular states that play an important role in
photochemistry and photovoltaics.  While on metal substrates the strong coupling
to the substrate and the continuous electronic density of states lead to
lifetimes of electronic excitations generally below 10 fs, the coupling and
electron transfer to the substrate can be reduced by introducing insulating
spacer layers such as oxides and much longer lifetimes are expected.
{acro;TR}-{acro;2PPE} provides experimental information on the electronic
structure of adsorbed molecules and the lifetimes of excited electrons.  The
detailed knowledge of the electronic states and electron transfer processes is
important for an understanding of the chemical and catalytic activity of
functional molecular structures on complex oxide surfaces, which rely on the
adsorption/reaction of small molecules at the metal center of the
metallotetrapyrroles.  These results will complement the spectroscopic
information obtained in `{funcos} 4`_.
