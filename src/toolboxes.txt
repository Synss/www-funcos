The {funcos} strategy will bring together two principal fields of expertise:
the surface science of oxide surfaces and the surface science of functional
molecular films, both including theory and experiment.  In order to assure that
research will be focused on common systems we have defined a **{funcos} Oxide
Toolbox** and a **{funcos} Molecular Toolbox**.

{funcos} Oxide Toolbox
----------------------

The idea of the {funcos} Oxide Toolbox is to provide a common set of model
surfaces for all groups.  The toolbox defines the starting materials and the
strategies for increasing complexity.  For all materials, we will start with
ordered surfaces and systematically proceed to more complex systems by studying
defect structures, deposited nanoparticles, and nanostructured oxides. 

{funcos} Molecular Toolbox
--------------------------

The surfaces defined by the {funcos} Oxide Toolbox are then combined with the
{funcos} Molecular Toolbox.  The {funcos} Molecular Toolbox specifies the
molecules to be investigated and the strategy for their modification.  The
molecules chosen are highly relevant to applications and provide exceptional
chemical flexibility.  They are mostly easily accessible and can be synthesized
by cooperating groups.  Moreover, they provide sufficient stability for surface
science experiments.  As a second component, the {funcos} Molecular Toolbox
contains a series of linker molecules with characteristic functional units.
After studying the specific interaction of linkers using small test molecules,
substituted functional molecules with linkers will be attached to the model
surfaces.

{funcos} Showcase Systems
-------------------------

The idea of {funcos} is to provide general concepts for growth, structure, and
property control of organic films on oxides.  However, success of the research
strategy has to be illustrated using specific examples at each project phase.
These examples are the {funcos} Showcase Systems.  Very importantly, these
Showcase Systems will also serve as a common guiding principle for coordinated
research, thus ensuring common focus of the individual projects.
